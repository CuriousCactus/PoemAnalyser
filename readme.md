# PoemAnalyser

Analysis of a poem is done in two steps.

## Conversion

Firstly, the poem (as a .txt file in ./data/) is converted to the phonetic alphabet using convert.py

## Visualisation

Secondly, the converted poem can be visualised using the GUI created by tk_colouring.py.

- A different poem can be chosen using the 'Open file' dialogue box.
- The highlighting can be changed using the 'Change colours' dialogue box.
  - Either vowels or consonants can be highlighted.
  - You can choose between two different colour schemes: Lois and Oli.
  - You can also choose to highlight only certain vowels or consonants using the checkboxes.
  
## Installation

The analysis can be run using convert.py and tk_colouring.py.
The GUI can alternatively be installed on a windows 64-bit machine using ./dist/PoemAnalyser-1.0.0-amd64.msi.
